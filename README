Troubleshooting:

Q: When I attempt to view a file or run a python script I get the following error:
Fatal Python error: Interpreter not initialized (version mismatch?)
A: On a mac add this to your .bashrc or .zshrc or .yourtermrc
DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks


How to build on Windows.
1) Get a coffee.
2) Book a few days off of work.
3) Install Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Express 2010 (or higher)
4) Download GTK-All-In-One windows package.


Redistributing for Mac OS X
---------------------------
1) Ensure that the environment variable LDFLAGS has -header_pad_max_install_names and -headerpad in it.
2) Install MacPorts and then install all required dependencies (boost+python27, GTKmm (+no_X11, +quartz), sqlite3).
3) Use cmake_release script to build the cmake script and then run make in the SpikeDB folder.
4) Ensure that the library_magic.py script runs and pulls in all required libraries to ./build/SpikeDB.app
5) In /opt/local/share/macports/Tcl/port1.0/portconfigure.tcl set  default configure.ldflags   {"-L${prefix}/lib -Xlinker -headerpad_max_install_names"}
