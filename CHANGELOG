Version 1.5
Released: ??

* Automatic database upgrades with new versions of SpikeDB at first launch.

* Python scripts must now be contained within a SpikeDBRun() function.

* Ability to create custom options for analysis scripts in a SpikeDBAdvanced()
method that calls addOptionCheckbox() or addOptionNumber().

* Check for new SpikeDB version automatically at launch.

* Graph data points can be given names and show up in status bar on mouse over
(see SpikeDB.setNames function).

* Graph data points can be given data to be used by SpikeDB later.
Currently supports being set to a TreePath from the SpikeDB.getCells()
"TreePath" item and then clicking on a datapoint brings you to that cell.

* Added a "bad" column to the Cells database to allow users to mark a bad cell
that should not be used in data analysis. Easier than hiding every file.

* Fixed memory issues with Python scripts that could cause errors.
